# Causal-2-Pedagogy

This repository aims to organize all the materials and teaching resources for PH243A, Advanced Topics in Causal Inference. The main goal is to create a repository of resources for graduate student instructors (GSIs) that has version control such that as labs, simulations, and other resources change between GSIs there is a running history that can trace these changes. Overall, this repository aims to provide information that can be used by future GSIs to incrementally make PH243A use more of the teaching methods detailed in the book _Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics_. Because of the amount of material covered in the course it is difficult to use different pedagogical methods 


# Lab 0

Historically this lab has been a R programming refresher. This can be useful for certain students who do not have R experience however it seems that what is more important is to instead have students work through this lab individually and use class time to review notation that is used in the class. This is particularly important to establish a foundation for all students to begin from. Experience teaching the course shows that midway into the course there is a division between students who can continue to understand more complicated estiamtors and those who get stuck. As such, this first lab time should be used to review a glossary of notation used in the _Targeted Learning_ books. Many students have confusion around $P_0$
